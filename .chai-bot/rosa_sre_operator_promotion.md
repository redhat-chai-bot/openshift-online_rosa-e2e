# Weekly SRE Operator Promotion — Scheduled Task Instructions

## Goal

Every week, check all SRE operators defined in `component-deployments.yaml` for new commits that haven't been promoted to production canary (wave 1). For each operator with new changes:

1. Compare the current production canary `ref` with the stage target `ref` (the latest pipeline-validated sha)
2. Analyze code changes for risk (risky patterns, missing e2e coverage) — informational for reviewers
3. If the stage ref differs from the prod-canary ref, create an MR in `gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface` updating the prod-canary targets
4. Post a summary to `#sre-operators` with threaded replies per operator

## The Promotion Pipeline Chain

Each saas file defines a promotion pipeline chain:

```
Integration (ref: master, auto) → promotion-int e2e → Stage (auto) → promotion-stage e2e → Prod-canary (MANUAL) → Prod wave-2 (auto, soakDays)
```

The stage target's `ref` represents the latest sha that has passed through the entire pipeline (integration deployment → promotion-int e2e → stage deployment → promotion-stage e2e). If a sha failed any e2e job, it would NOT appear in the stage target. There is no need to independently check Prow CI health — the pipeline already gates everything.

## Important Rules

- **ALWAYS produce a Slack report** — even if no operators need promotion, post a summary message.
- **One threaded reply per operator** — each operator's details MUST be posted as its own separate threaded reply using `---THREAD_BREAK---` delimiters between operators. NEVER batch multiple operators into the parent message or into a single reply. The parent message contains ONLY the header and summary statistics, separated from threaded replies by `---THREAD_DETAILS---`.
- **One MR per operator** — each operator gets its own MR (not batched). This allows independent review and rollback.
- **Only modify the `ref` field** in prod-canary targets. Never change namespace refs, parameters, promotion subscriptions, or any other field.
- **Only promote a sha that has progressed through all pipeline stages** (integration → stage). The stage target ref in the saas file represents the latest validated sha.
- **Do not compare against GitHub HEAD** — the pipeline determines what is ready for promotion. Use the stage target ref as the source of truth.
- **Do not create an MR if there are no new pipeline-validated changes** — if stage ref == prod-canary ref, skip.
- **Discover operators dynamically** — read `configs/component-deployments.yaml` at runtime rather than using a hardcoded list. This ensures new operators are automatically included.

## Operator Discovery

The authoritative list of operators is defined in `configs/component-deployments.yaml` in the `openshift-online/rosa-e2e` GitHub repository. Read this file at runtime to discover the operators to process.

### Discovery procedure

1. **Read `configs/component-deployments.yaml`** from `openshift-online/rosa-e2e` on GitHub
2. **Filter for promotable components**: Select all entries with `strategy: hive` (these are SRE operators deployed via the Hive pipeline). Also include `managed-cluster-config` explicitly.
3. **Exclude non-operator components**: After filtering for `strategy: hive`, remove these keys — they are not SRE operators:
   - `hive` (the Hive deployment itself)
   - `osd-rhobs-rules-and-dashboards` (observability rules/dashboards, not a deployable operator)
4. **Include all remaining hive-strategy components**: Some operators have not yet migrated to Prow-based e2e testing (they lack an `e2e_saas` field in `component-deployments.yaml`). These are still included — they have stage and prod-canary targets in their saas files and follow the same promotion pipeline pattern. Do not skip operators just because they lack `e2e_saas`. Operators currently without Prow migration include:
   - `pagerduty-operator`
   - `deadmanssnitch-operator`
   - `gcp-project-operator`
   - `managed-cluster-config`
   - `managed-velero-operator`
   - `managed-cluster-validating-webhooks`
   - `managed-node-metadata-operator`
5. **For each component, extract**:
   - `saas_name` — the saas resource name in app-interface (e.g. `saas-route-monitor-operator-pko`, `saas-muo`). This is the `name:` field inside the saas YAML file in app-interface, NOT the file path.
   - `repo` — the GitHub repository (e.g. `openshift/route-monitor-operator`)
6. **Find the saas file in app-interface**: Search `data/services/osd-operators/cicd/saas/` in `gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface` for a YAML file whose top-level `name:` field matches the `saas_name`. Note that the file name on disk may differ from the `saas_name` (e.g. `saas_name: saas-muo` → file is `saas-managed-upgrade-operator.yaml`).

### Important notes on saas_name vs file paths

- The `saas_name` is the **resource identifier** used inside app-interface (the `name:` field at the top of each saas YAML file)
- The `saas_name` may be an abbreviation that does NOT match the file name on disk (e.g. `saas-muo` vs `saas-managed-upgrade-operator.yaml`, `saas-cdo-pko` vs `saas-custom-domains-operator-pko.yaml`)
- Always use the `saas_name` to identify the correct saas resource, then locate its file by searching for a file containing `name: <saas_name>` at the top level
- Do not hardcode file paths — discover them dynamically using the `saas_name`

All saas files are under `data/services/osd-operators/cicd/saas/` in `gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface`.

## Procedure

### 1. Process all operators, then post to Slack

Complete ALL operator processing (steps 2–4) first, collecting results for every operator before posting anything to Slack. Once all results are collected, post to Slack following the Delivery Order below.

### Delivery Order

After all operators are processed (steps 2–4), compose the full response and post to Slack:

**A. Parent message** — the first part of the response, containing ONLY the header and summary statistics. No individual operator details:

> 🚀 **Weekly SRE Operator Promotion — <today's date>**
> cc @osd-operators-saas-approver
>
> **Summary:**
> - ✅ Promoted: <N> operators
> - ⚠️ Promoted with flags: <N> operators
> - 🔍 Pipeline anomalies: <N> operators
> - ⏭️ Skipped (no changes): <N> operators
> - Total MRs created: <N>

Use `<!subteam^S0BLN6AN7EK>` to mention the @osd-operators-saas-approver group.

**B. Threaded replies** — after the parent summary, include per-operator details as separate threaded replies using the delimiter-based threading system. Put `---THREAD_DETAILS---` after the parent summary, then `---THREAD_BREAK---` between each operator's reply. Each operator gets its own threaded reply — one reply per operator (see Section 5 for format templates). Order operators by priority:
1. Promoted with flags (⚠️) — most attention needed
2. Promoted low risk (✅)
3. Pipeline anomalies (🔍)
4. Skipped / no changes (⏭️)

**Response delivery:** Compose everything — parent summary + all operator replies — as a **single** `set_response_element` call. The platform splits on the delimiters automatically. Do NOT use separate `set_response_element` calls for the parent and threads.

**Validation gate:** Before calling `send_response()`, verify your response content contains `---THREAD_DETAILS---`. If the delimiter is missing, the operator details will not be posted as threaded replies — go back and add it.

> **Critical**: Never put operator details in the parent message. Never batch multiple operators into a single threaded reply. One reply = one operator, separated by `---THREAD_BREAK---`.

Example structure:

```
{parent summary}

---THREAD_DETAILS---

✅ **operator-a** — 3 new commits, low risk (boilerplate only).
MR: <gitlab MR link>
Changes: <GitHub compare link>

---THREAD_BREAK---

⚠️ **operator-b** — 5 new commits. Code changes without e2e tests.
MR: <gitlab MR link>
Changes: <GitHub compare link>
_Flags: Code changes without e2e tests, RBAC modifications_

---THREAD_BREAK---

⏭️ **operator-c** — No new pipeline-validated changes. Skipping.
```

### 2. For each operator — Check for pipeline-validated changes

For each operator discovered from `component-deployments.yaml`:

1. **Read the saas file** from app-interface using GitLab tools:
   - Use the `saas_name` from `component-deployments.yaml` to find the matching saas resource in app-interface. Search for files in `data/services/osd-operators/cicd/saas/` whose `name:` field matches the `saas_name`.
   - Parse the YAML to find all `resourceTemplates` entries

2. **Find the stage targets**: Search for targets that have `auto: true` in their promotion block and subscribe to integration/e2e success channels. These typically have names containing `-stage-` or `-hives0` patterns. Each operator typically has two stage targets (one per hive shard).

3. **Find the prod-canary targets**: Search for target names containing `prod-canary`. Each operator typically has two:
   - `<prefix>-hivep03uw1-prod-canary`
   - `<prefix>-hivep04ew2-prod-canary`
   
   The prefix varies per operator (e.g. `rmo-`, `co-`, `oao-`, `mcc-`). Match by the `prod-canary` suffix.

4. **Extract the stage ref**: Get the `ref` (git sha) from the stage targets. This is the latest pipeline-validated sha — it has passed through integration deployment, promotion-int e2e, stage deployment, and promotion-stage e2e.

5. **Extract the prod-canary ref**: Get the `ref` (git sha) from the prod-canary targets. This is the current production sha.

6. **Validate targets agree**: Confirm that both stage targets have the same `ref`, and both prod-canary targets have the same `ref`. If either pair disagrees, flag it as a pipeline anomaly in the Slack thread. Post a threaded reply:
   > 🔍 **<operator-name>** — Stage targets disagree on ref (hivep03: <sha1>, hivep04: <sha2>). Skipping — investigate pipeline.
   
   Skip this operator and move to the next.

7. **Compare**: If `stage ref == prod-canary ref` → no new pipeline-validated changes. Post a threaded reply:
   > ⏭️ **<operator-name>** — No new pipeline-validated changes. Skipping.
   
   Move to the next operator.

### 3. For each operator with changes — Analyze code diff

If the stage ref differs from the prod-canary ref, there are new pipeline-validated changes ready for promotion.

> **Note**: This analysis is informational for reviewers — the pipeline has already validated the sha through promotion-int and promotion-stage e2e jobs.

1. **Get the commit list** between the prod-canary ref and the stage ref using GitHub tools. Count the commits and list their summaries.

2. **Categorize the changes** by reviewing the diff:
   - **Boilerplate / Low Risk**: dependency bumps (`go.mod`, `go.sum`, `vendor/`), generated code, `Makefile` updates, `Dockerfile` updates, `.github/` CI config, documentation changes
   - **Code Changes / Medium Risk**: modifications to Go source files under `pkg/`, `cmd/`, `controllers/`, `api/`
   - **High Risk Patterns**: Look specifically for:
     - RBAC changes (`role.yaml`, `clusterrole.yaml`, `*_rbac.go`)
     - CRD changes (`*_crd.yaml`, `*_types.go`, API version changes)
     - Webhook changes (`webhook*.go`, `validating*.yaml`, `mutating*.yaml`)
     - Security context changes
     - New dependencies on external services

   High-risk patterns should be **flagged with a warning** in the Slack thread and MR description, but do NOT hold the MR — still create it. The reviewer can decide whether to merge.

3. **Check for e2e test coverage**: Look for changes in `test/`, `e2e/`, `osde2e/` directories in the diff.
   - If there are **code changes but NO e2e changes** → flag: `⚠️ Code changes without e2e test updates`
   - If there are **only boilerplate changes** → no e2e flag needed

### 4. For each operator — Create promotion MR

If the stage ref differs from the prod-canary ref:

1. **Prepare the saas file change**: Update ONLY the `ref` field in both prod-canary targets to the stage ref sha. Do not modify any other fields.

2. **Create the MR** on `gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface`:
   - **Title**: `Promote <operator-name> to prod-canary (<short-sha>)`
   - **Target branch**: `master`
   - **File to change**: The saas file discovered via the `saas_name` lookup (under `data/services/osd-operators/cicd/saas/`)
   - **Description** (use this template):

```

## Risk Assessment

<brief summary of risk level and any flags>
```

3. **Post threaded reply** to the parent Slack message with the result.

### 5. Threaded reply format per operator

Use these emoji-prefixed formats for the threaded replies:

**Promoted successfully (low risk):**
> ✅ **<operator-name>** — <N> new commits, low risk (boilerplate only).
> MR: <gitlab MR link>
> Changes: <GitHub compare link>

**Promoted with flags (medium/high risk):**
> ⚠️ **<operator-name>** — <N> new commits. <risk flags>.
> MR: <gitlab MR link>
> Changes: <GitHub compare link>
> _Flags: <list flags, e.g. "Code changes without e2e tests", "RBAC modifications">_

**Pipeline anomaly (targets disagree):**
> 🔍 **<operator-name>** — Stage targets disagree on ref (hivep03: <sha1>, hivep04: <sha2>). Skipping — investigate pipeline.

**No changes:**
> ⏭️ **<operator-name>** — No new pipeline-validated changes. Skipping.

### 6. Summary statistics

The summary statistics are included directly in the parent message (see Delivery Order, Step A). There is no separate summary threaded reply. Compute the counts from collected results before posting the parent message:

> - ✅ Promoted: <N> operators
> - ⚠️ Promoted with flags: <N> operators
> - 🔍 Pipeline anomalies: <N> operators
> - ⏭️ Skipped (no changes): <N> operators
> - Total MRs created: <N>

## Error Handling

- If you cannot read a saas file from app-interface → log the error in the thread and continue with the next operator
- If you cannot find stage targets in the saas file → log it as an anomaly and skip that operator
- If MR creation fails → log the error in the thread with the specific failure reason
- **Never skip the Slack report** — always post the parent message and at least a summary, even if everything fails

## Technical Notes

- The saas files use `$ref` for namespace references — these are YAML references internal to app-interface, not git refs. Do not confuse them with the git `ref` field.
- Some saas files have multiple `resourceTemplates` entries (e.g. managed-cluster-config has `managed-cluster-config-integration` and `managed-cluster-config-production`). The prod-canary targets are in the production template. Only modify the production template.
- The `promotion.subscribe` blocks in the saas file define automated promotion channels — do not modify these.
- Both prod-canary targets (`hivep03uw1` and `hivep04ew2`) should always be updated to the same ref in a single MR.
- The stage targets represent shas that have passed through the full promotion pipeline (integration deployment → promotion-int e2e → stage deployment → promotion-stage e2e). There is no need to independently check Prow CI health — the pipeline already gates everything.
- Stage targets typically have `auto: true` in their promotion block and subscribe to integration/e2e success channels.
